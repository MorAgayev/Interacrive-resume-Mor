            During my degree I used various programs such as AXURE, ADOBE XD, Premier, Unity etc.
            And I performed a UX final project in VR technology.
            I also studied product management, user psychology, media marketing as part of my degree.</td>

            After a class where I first learned to write code as part of a game
            design course at UNITY I realized I had a desire to know more.
            After graduating I decided to start studying the world of programming.
            During the course I learned HTML, CSS & JAVA SCRIPT (I wrote in the ATOM editor).
            Using the tools I received in the course I started to build sites that can be
            seen later and the first site I built was my interactive resume site.
            In addition, I was exposed to sites like MDN, W3SCHOOL, COLOR-HUNT etc.
            that help me keep learning all the time.</td>
